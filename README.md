## About:
Outside of classes, this is my first little personal project. I definitely enjoyed making the game and I am always open to making it better.

I wanted to make a very simple game, so after some google searches I decided to go with a clicker game. I thought creating a clicker game would be the easiest to pick up, and I would learn the most by using Java. I was inspired to use an octopus as the main character and had many ideas to improve the game including bubbles and confetti.

[2025 Update] I am currently going back through this repository to clean it up and make it useable. It is enjoyable to see how far I have come and what I am able to create now compared to 2022. I wanted to update this repository to make this game playable and accessable for anyone, including myself, if they wanted to try it. Thanks, see you around!

## Installation:
For ease of use, this repository is formatted to be IDE agnostic. All you have to do is clone this repository and then open the folder (or project) in the IDE of your choice and run the clickerLayout.java file for it to work. 

Have fun trying it out and don't be afraid to reach out if any issues are found or improvements could be made. I hope you enjoy and thank you! Email: lamontagneaustin@gmail.com
