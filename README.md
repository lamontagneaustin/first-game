## About:
Outside of classes, this is my first ever little personal project. Definitely a good time making the game and always open to making it better.

## Inspiration:
I wanted to make a very simple game so after some google searches I decided to go with a clicker game because I thought it would be the easiest and I would learn the most using Java. I inspired to use an octopus as the main character and given ideas to make the game better including bubbles and confetti.
