## About:
Outside of classes, this is my first ever little personal project. Definitely a good time making the game and always open to making it better.

I wanted to make a very simple game so after some google searches I decided to go with a clicker game because I thought it would be the easiest and I would learn the most using Java. I inspired to use an octopus as the main character and given ideas to make the game better including bubbles and confetti.

## Installation:
For ease of use, this repository is formatted to be IDE agnostic. All you have to do is clone this repository and then open the folder (or project) in the IDE of your choice and run the clickerLayout.java file for it to work. 

Have fun trying it out and don't be afraid to reach out if any issues are found or improvements could be made! Email: lamontagneaustin@gmail.com
